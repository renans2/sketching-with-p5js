# Sketching with P5.js

This repo is dedicated to publish my **sketches** using the **[P5.js](https://p5js.org/)** library for **JavaScript**, which allows you to draw **2D/3D graphics** and **animations** on the web, being one of the most popular alternatives for learning **creative coding** and **generative art**.

***(I have another repo for my sketches using [Processing](https://processing.org/ "Processing"), that you can access [here](https://github.com/renans2/sketching-with-processing)).***

In order to see my sketches, all you have to do is to choose one folder and open the correspondent `.html` (after cloning the repository, of course). Or you could copy and paste the code on the [web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).

P5 is a great way to starting programming too. You can try coding at their [web editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).

> Many of the ideas for the sketches were inspired by [Daniel Shiffman](https://x.com/shiffman)'s work published on his [Youtube channel: The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain).
